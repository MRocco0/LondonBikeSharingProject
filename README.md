# LondonBikeSharingProject
Within this project I gathered data from the London Bike Sharing Dataset from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)

Using PANDAS in Python I cleaned, manipulated, and explored the data.

Using Tableau I created 5 visualizations and generated 1 dashboard.
